# Introduction

## Sexual selection theory and mating strategies

### The Darwin-Bateman paradigm

Until a relatively recent diversification of approaches, sexual selection theory has long been used to assert that differences in mating strategies between the sexes arise from a fundamental dichotomy between "coy females" and "promiscuous males" - sometimes characterised as the "Darwin-Bateman paradigm" [@borgerhoffmulder2021; @dewsbury2005]. As the name would suggest, it is rooted in @darwin1981 's early assertion that males in almost all animal species are more eager and less discriminate than females when it comes to reproduction. This, Darwin continues, makes them the primary target of evolution via sexual selection - either through male-male competition or through female choice, the inverse processes of which (e.g. female-female competition, etc.) he largely neglects. Darwin, of course, could only speculate about the origin of these sex differences, which he tentatively reasoned to be driven by the fact that insemination requires males to closely approach females, thus selecting for an "eagerness" in males to seek out the opposite sex [@darwin1981]. But the brevity with which this, entirely non-empirical, explanation is offered in The Descent of Man perhaps speaks to the lack of confidence Darwin had in this line of reasoning. In any case, Darwin's ideas on sexual selection and the associated coy female-ardent male dichotomy largely languished in scientific no-man's land until the latter half of the eponymous paradigm, Angus J. Bateman, published an article titled "Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila" in Heredity in 1948. Here, @bateman1948 publishes two key findings that would prove very influential for the science of mating systems: For one, he found that mating success in males was significantly more variable than mating success in females. This held both on a group level, with 1 in 5 males failing to reproduce where for females, it was only 1 in 25, as well as on the individual level, where number of offspring varied much more between individual males than between individual females. The second finding was that, additionally, reproductive success of males seemed to increase linearly with number of mates - indicating that males should strictly prefer more mating opportunities (i.e. promiscuity), within the constraints of Bateman's experiments. Female reproductive success, on the other hand, did not seem to benefit from additional mates beyond the first one. This relationship between number of mates (or "mating success") and reproductive success is referred to as Bateman's gradient, the slope of which, after Bateman, is often posited to be steeper for males than for females [@gerlach2012]. Collectively, Bateman's results were enshrined in modern sexual-selection research as "Bateman's principles", seemingly offering an elegant explanation for sex differences in sexual selection that had eluded Darwin [@arnold1994], and which continue to exert considerable influence on contemporary sexual selection research [e.g. @janicke2016]. @bateman1948 explained these results by invoking anisogamy - male sex cells (gametes) are comparatively small and metabolically inexpensive, whereas female gametes are expensive and thus constitute the limiting factor on female reproduction. Like his results, the idea of anisogamy as an underlying cause was later picked up by @trivers1972, who in his landmark chapter on parental investment (cited 15940 times according to Google Scholar) argued that sex differences in post-zygotic parental investment (i.e. parental care) followed logically from anisogamy, which he recognises as form of pre-zygotic parental investment. Subsequently, in circumstances under which males and females differ in their parental investment, they ought to differ in their reproductive strategies, with the least invested sex being more promiscuous [@trivers1972]. Interestingly, invoking anisogamy as the ultimate cause for sex-differences in mating behaviour poses the corollary question of what, ultimately, causes anisogamy, which similarly has been subject of much scientific interest, notably by Geoff Parker and researcher influenced by him [@parker1972; @lehtonen2011], which is why the aforementioned "Darwin-Bateman paradigm" is sometimes more completely, but rather confusingly, described as the "Darwin-Bateman-Trivers-Parker paradigm" of sexual selection and the evolution of sex roles [@hoquet2020]. [Perhaps expound briefly on the influence the paradigm has had in comparative/animal-based work?]

In his original paper, @bateman1948 himself only alludes in passing to generalising his results to humans, though he was convinced that his results would extend to many species in which anisogamy holds.
